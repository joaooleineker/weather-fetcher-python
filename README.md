weather-fetcher-python is a Python project that uses the WeatherAPI to fetch and display real-time weather information. It allows users to quickly and easily search for weather data from any city worldwide, including details such as temperature, weather conditions, and humidity.

Features: Fetch real-time weather information, support for multiple cities, display details such as: city and country, current temperature (°C), weather condition (e.g., Sunny, Cloudy), relative humidity(%). 

Technologies Used: Python: Main programming language, Requests: To perform HTTP calls to the API, WeatherAPI: Source of weather data.

How to use: Get a free API key from WeatherAPI, insert your key into the weather_fetcher file (in the API_KEY variable), then run the script and enter the city name to retrieve weather data.

Roadmap: Add suport for other measurement units (°F), improve the user interface (e.g., GUI or web interface), implement support for future weather forecasts.
